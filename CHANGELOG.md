## Version `v2.0.1` (2022-04-16)

Bugfixes:

- Remove `node`/`yarn` from dependencies. Gradle tasks install it into the build
  folder if needed.

## Version `v2.0.0` (2022-04-6)

❗ This major update includes docker images (see [`Readme.md`](Readme.md)) and
some major clean up on the directory structure of the repository. The major
changes include

- Pandoc `2.17` is used in all docker images.
- The `convert` folder has been moved to `tools/convert` to **decouple** the
  build from the markdown source. The upgrade makes it possible to use docker
  images `technical-markdown:<version>` to build your own sources without the
  need to have the `tools` folder also in your own repository. Also a different
  source layout is possible by adapting the `build.gradle.kts`. If you want to
  experiment in your fork or own repository with different layouts/styling and
  `pandoc` conversions you can use the `technical-markdown:<version>-minimal`
  image which does not include the tools folder. Any feature improvement which
  could be of general interest is highly welcome.
